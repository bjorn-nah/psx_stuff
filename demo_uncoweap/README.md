# Unconventional Weapons
This demo only support PAL video mode (Yet?)\
Tested on Pal system (SCPH-5502) and emulator. This project is the result of weeks on playing with the PSn00bSDK and never append without PS1USB cartridge by Orion.\
The mod player was an adaptation of the PCSX-Redux player witch is itself an retro-engineering of the hitmen's one, the mod converter is also made by PCSX-Redux.\
In the tool directory you can found obj2psx, a little python script to convert .obj 3D models to PSX binaries.\
